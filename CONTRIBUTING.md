## Getting Started

If you're unfamiliar with any of the instructions, you can navigate the [rest of this guide](#technologies) to figure out the relevant technology and potential environment issues. <b>If an instruction begins with "Run ...", that means to type the text in place of ... within your CLI.</b>

You can get an invite to our Slack channel by [requesting to join Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/join). Once in our Slack team, simply type: `/open #on-belay` and then click enter.
